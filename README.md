# [Re] Watts–Strogatz Small-World Networks  

This repository contains a reproducible replication of the *Watts & Strogatz (1998)* small-world network model, prepared for submission to ReScience C.


## Summary
This project replicates the emergence of small-world behavior in networks as described in *Nature 393 (6684): 440–442*.  
All code runs in Google COlab using open-source Python libraries.  

**Key metrics analyzed:**
- Clustering coefficient C(G)
- Characteristic path length L(G)
- Global efficiency E(G)
- Degree variance & assortativity
- Lattice-edge fraction for rewiring validation  


## How to Run
You can reproduce all results using the Colab notebook provided in this repository.  
1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Run all cells — outputs will be saved automatically (figures + CSV data).
